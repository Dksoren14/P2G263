# Bucky_Kinematics
 ##### Forward kinematics, inverse kinematics and simulation tool.

### General Info
The program runs very unstable. Many operations require a specific sequence to function properly or to prevent crashes. Fixes and more documentation might come in the future.  


### Bucky_Kinematics is the sketch folder for Processing java.

Libaries needed:
- controlP5 by Andreas Schlegel (Can be installed in the libary manager)
- Processing Serial by Processing (Can be installed in the libary manager)
- Apache Commons Mathematics Library version 3 (Is located **Bucky_Kinematics>code>"commons-math3-3.6.1.jar"**). No further action needed if the sketch folder is downloaded whole. 


### Arduino_side/P2 is the code for the arduino, to control servo motors.

Libaries needed:
- Dynamixel2Arduino by ROBOTIS (Can be installed in the libary manager)
- DynamixelShield by ROBOTIS (Can be installed in the libary manager)
- Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library by Adafruit (Can be installed in the libary manager)

### Demonstration
